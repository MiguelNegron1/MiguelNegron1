# 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel

I'm a data analyst passionate about turning raw data into clear, actionable insights that solve real business problems.

🔍 I specialize in:

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for data extraction and transformation  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** for analysis and data visualization  
- **Tableau & Power BI** for interactive dashboards and storytelling  
- **Google Colab & GitHub** for project sharing and collaboration  

📊 My work includes projects like:

- **Black Friday Sales Analysis** — full data pipeline (SQL, Python, Tableau)  
- **Telco Customer Churn** — exploratory analysis and modeling with SQL + Python  
- **Hands-on dashboards** in both **Tableau and Power BI** (based on guided case studies)

🧠 I'm currently focused on:

- Improving my machine learning skills for predictive analytics  
- Building a portfolio that reflects real-world business challenges  
- Transitioning into a remote data analyst role where I can bring value and grow
